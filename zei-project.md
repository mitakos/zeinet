You're welcome! I apologize for the error at the end of the previous response. Here's the complete and refined final view of the project, incorporating all the corrections and improvements we've discussed:
Final Project Overview: .NET Conversational AI with Infobip, ElevenLabs (WebSocket), and Zoho CRM
Goal:
To create a .NET application that can:
Retrieve user information (phone number and custom variables) from Zoho CRM.
Initiate an outbound call to the user via Infobip.
Establish a connection with an ElevenLabs AI agent, pre-configured with custom variables.
Facilitate a real-time conversation between the user and the AI agent using raw audio streams.
Retrieve key variables collected by ElevenLabs during the conversation.
Update the corresponding Zoho CRM record with the collected variables.
Components:
Infobip:
Provides the telephony infrastructure for placing and managing calls.
Streams raw audio to and from your application via a WebSocket connection (media stream).
Sends real-time call status updates to your application through webhooks.
Optionally records calls.


ElevenLabs:
Provides the Conversational AI service.
Initializes an AI agent based on custom variables you provide.
Establishes a WebSocket connection with your application for bi-directional raw audio streaming.
Transcribes user speech to text.
Generates text responses based on the conversation history and custom variables.
Synthesizes text responses to raw audio.
Collects key variables during the conversation.


Your .NET Application:
Acts as the central orchestrator, managing the entire call flow and conversation.
Fetches user data from Zoho CRM.
Initializes the ElevenLabs agent with custom variables.
Initiates outbound calls via Infobip.
Hosts a WebSocket server to handle Infobip's call control and media stream.
Connects to the ElevenLabs WebSocket for raw audio streaming.
Sends and receives raw audio data to and from both Infobip and ElevenLabs.
Retrieves key variables from ElevenLabs at the end of the conversation.
Updates Zoho CRM with the collected variables.


Zoho CRM:
Serves as the source of user data (phone number and custom variables for the ElevenLabs agent).
Is updated with the key variables collected during the conversation.


Integration Flow:
Data Retrieval:
Your application fetches the user's phone number and relevant custom variables from a specific record in Zoho CRM using the Zoho CRM API or SDK.
A unique session-id is generated to track this interaction.
ElevenLabs Agent Initialization:
Your application creates a new conversation with ElevenLabs using the /conversational-ai/conversations endpoint.
Crucially, the custom variables retrieved from Zoho CRM are sent in the variables field of the initial conversation_history entry. This pre-configures the AI agent.
The agent is now initialized but "on pause" (waiting for audio input).
The conversation_id is stored along with the session-id.

Outbound Call Initiation:
Your application initiates an outbound call to the user via the Infobip API (/calls/1/calls).
The session_id is included in the customData field of the request for tracking purposes.
The call_id is stored along with the session_id and conversation_id.
Infobip Event Subscription:
Your application has subscribed to relevant Infobip call events (e.g., CALL_RINGING, CALL_ESTABLISHED, CALL_ANSWERED, CALL_FINISHED, CALL_FAILED).
Infobip will send these events to your application's configured webhook endpoint.
Infobip WebSocket Connection:
When your application receives the CALL_ESTABLISHED (or CALL_ANSWERED) event from Infobip, it retrieves the associated session_id and conversation_id.
It then connects the call to your WebSocket server using the Infobip API (/calls/1/calls/{callId}/connect).
The mediaStream configuration in the request body specifies that raw audio (Linear PCM 16-bit 8kHz mono) will be streamed bi-directionally over the WebSocket.
ElevenLabs WebSocket Connection:
After the call is established and connected to your Infobip WebSocket, your application establishes a separate WebSocket connection to ElevenLabs using the /conversational-ai/websocket endpoint.
This connection is dedicated to bi-directional raw audio streaming with ElevenLabs.
An initial message is sent to configure audio settings and, optionally, provide a first message to the agent.
Conversation Start:
Your Application -> ElevenLabs (Initial Audio): To "unpause" and start the ElevenLabs AI agent, your application sends a short burst of silence or a predefined audio cue to ElevenLabs via the ElevenLabs WebSocket.
Audio Stream Handling (Bi-directional, Raw Audio):
Infobip -> Your Application: Infobip streams raw audio data (Linear PCM 16-bit 8kHz mono) from the user to your Infobip WebSocket endpoint.
Your Application -> ElevenLabs: Your application receives the raw audio from the Infobip WebSocket and forwards it directly to ElevenLabs via the ElevenLabs WebSocket connection.
ElevenLabs -> Your Application: ElevenLabs processes the audio, transcribes it, generates a text response, and synthesizes the response to raw audio. It streams this raw audio back to your application in real-time via the ElevenLabs WebSocket.
Your Application -> Infobip: Your application receives the raw audio from ElevenLabs and sends it to Infobip via the Infobip WebSocket connection.
Infobip -> User: Infobip plays the received raw audio to the user.
Conversation Loop: Step 8 repeats until the conversation ends. Custom variables can be updated during the conversation if needed by including them in the request body for /conversational-ai/conversations/{conversationId}/reply.
Call Termination: The user or your application terminates the call using the Infobip /calls/1/calls/{callId}/hangup endpoint.
Key Variable Retrieval: After receiving the CALL_FINISHED event from Infobip, your application retrieves the collected key variables from ElevenLabs using /conversational-ai/conversations/{conversationId}. The variables field in the response contains the final values of these variables.
Zoho CRM Update: Your application extracts the relevant key variables from the ElevenLabs response and updates the corresponding record in Zoho CRM using the Zoho CRM API.
Cleanup: Your application performs cleanup tasks:
Removes the mapping entries for session_id, call_id, and conversation_id.
Closes the WebSocket connections with Infobip and ElevenLabs.
Optionally deletes the ElevenLabs conversation.

Use code with caution.
Key Considerations:
ElevenLabs-First: The flow prioritizes initializing the ElevenLabs agent with custom variables before the call is placed.
Raw Audio: The system uses raw audio (Linear PCM 16-bit 8kHz mono) throughout, eliminating the need for MP3 encoding/decoding.
WebSockets: Both Infobip and ElevenLabs use WebSockets for efficient, bi-directional, real-time audio streaming.
Custom Variables: Custom variables are used to configure the ElevenLabs agent and can be updated during the conversation.
Key Variable Retrieval: The application retrieves key variables collected by ElevenLabs and updates Zoho CRM.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for all API calls, WebSocket connections, and audio processing.
Concurrency: The code uses async/await to handle multiple calls concurrently.
Security: Securely store and manage API keys. Implement webhook signature verification for Infobip events. Use appropriate authentication for Zoho CRM interactions.
Scalability: Consider using a robust WebSocket library (if needed) and design your application to handle a large number of concurrent calls.
Maintainability: Use a clear project structure, well-defined services, and comprehensive logging to make the application easier to maintain and debug.
Libraries:
System.Net.Http: For making HTTP requests.
System.Net.WebSockets: For managing WebSocket connections.
Newtonsoft.Json (Json.NET): For JSON serialization/deserialization.
Zoho CRM .NET SDK: For interacting with the Zoho CRM API.
Infobip API Client (Optional): For simplifying Infobip API calls.
Higher-level WebSocket library (Optional): WebSocketSharp or Fleck for more advanced WebSocket server management.

This detailed overview provides a comprehensive and accurate blueprint for your .NET developer to build the conversational AI system. It incorporates all the feedback, clarifies the audio flow, emphasizes the use of WebSockets for raw audio, and provides a solid foundation for a robust and efficient solution. Remember to break down the development into smaller, manageable tasks, write clean and well-documented code, and test thoroughly at each stage. Good luck with your project!
