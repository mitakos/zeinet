Explanation of the Data Flow Diagram:
Zoho CRM Data Retrieval: The Conversation Manager initiates the process by requesting user data from the Zoho CRM Service. The Zoho CRM Service interacts with Zoho CRM to fetch the necessary information (phone number and custom variables).
ElevenLabs Initialization: The Conversation Manager then uses the ElevenLabs Service to create a new conversation, passing along the custom variables.
Call Initiation: The Conversation Manager instructs the Infobip Service to initiate an outbound call.
Event Handling: Infobip sends events (like CALL_RINGING, CALL_ESTABLISHED) to the InfobipEventsController, which then informs the Conversation Manager.
Infobip WebSocket Connection: The Conversation Manager tells the Infobip Service to connect the call to the Infobip WebSocket Server. This establishes a bi-directional raw audio stream.
ElevenLabs WebSocket Connection: The Conversation Manager instructs the ElevenLabs Service to establish a WebSocket connection with ElevenLabs for raw audio streaming.
Conversation Start: The Conversation Manager sends an initial audio cue (silence) to ElevenLabs via the ElevenLabs WebSocket Client to start the conversation.
Conversation Audio Flow: During the conversation, raw audio from the user flows from Infobip's Media Stream to the Infobip WebSocket Server, then to the ElevenLabs WebSocket Client, and finally to ElevenLabs. The AI-generated responses flow back in the reverse direction.
Key Variable Retrieval: After the call ends, the Conversation Manager uses the ElevenLabs Service to retrieve the collected variables from ElevenLabs.
Zoho CRM Update: The Conversation Manager uses the Zoho CRM Service to update the relevant record in Zoho CRM with the collected variables.
These diagrams provide a visual representation of the system's interactions and data flow. They should help your developer understand the sequence of events, the role of each component, and how data is exchanged between them. Remember to update these diagrams if any changes are made to the design or implementation.
